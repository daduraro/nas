# Restore DB backup

1. Set-up new clean db (remove pg_data)

```
docker compose up db
```

2. Run restore backup

```
docker compose run -v $PWD/backup:/baserow/backups backend restore -f /baserow/backups/<DAY>.tar.gz 
```

# Upgrade

1. Download new docker compose file

```
curl -o docker-compose.yml.new  https://gitlab.com/baserow/baserow/-/raw/master/docker-compose.yml
```

2. Manually compare with old one and do `docker compose down`, rename, `docker compose pull` and `docker compose up -d`.
